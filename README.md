#A continuous-state Markov Chain is essentially a Time Series. The notebook is an oversimplified example of how the markov chain mathematically is a time series. 

When a Markov Chain is extended to a Continuous State Space, it becomes a Time Series.
The probability transition matrix must transition to a continuous form.
This is defined using a stochastic kernel, as illustrated below.
The result? A time series emergesâ€”in this case, a random walk.
Amazing, isn't it?

On the flip side, if you discretize a time series in state space, you get a Markov chain.
